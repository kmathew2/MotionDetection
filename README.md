# MotionDetection
A simple Android app was created to perform Motion Detection and Brightness Control using OpenCV. In case of motion in the camera frame, a message will be displayed on screen. If the brightness of the scene is high, the camera will reduce the brightness and adjust the pixel intensities and vice versa.
